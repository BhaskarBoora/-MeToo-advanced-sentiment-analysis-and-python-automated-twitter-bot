# -MeToo-twitter-Advance-sentiment-analysis-and-support
This project was built by a team of 4 members in the 3rd edition of IIT ISM annual hackathon Hackfest_18 within 36 hours.
The #MeToo tags on twitter will be used to perform advanced sentiment analysis and provide support to the movement.
Description- Sexual Harassment is a growing problem in the world, especially in the workplace. Working women find it difficult to talk to anyone about the harassment they have endured fearing the loss of the job. This causes feelings to remain hidden for long stretches of time which leads to, in the majority of cases, long-term depression, loss of jobs and in extreme cases even suicide. #MeToo movement on Twitter and Facebook provided women with courage and the platform to put forth their emotions.We designed a python application which picks up tweets & retweets from Twitter containing the #MeToo hashtag using pre-existing Twitter API's. Our web-based application will use Python scripting & libraries, machine learning algorithm, and Natural Language Processing to do a Sentiment Analysis and grade each such t post in 4 major emotional categories. This web application will be implemented through a Twitter ID which will first perform a basic task using machine learning and Sentiment Analysis that is, validate the genuineness of the post by making a database and then commenting/retweeting on the tweet/post appropriately.

# -Getting starterd
To use the given program, you will need to download the three python files present in the repository. Run only the runcode.py file through a python IDE to execute the program.
Prerequisites:
install Tweepy library,TextBlob library and csv library which are python based before running the code.
NOTE- For security purpose, the Twitter API credentials used in the program have been removed. Add your own Twitter App credentials in the Code_fort.py file.

# -Running the test
Run the coderun.py program through any python IDE. The program will automatically take out approximately 15 tweets from the Twitter. There wont be any output to see in the terminal. But you will find 2 csv files in the same repository which contains the formatted input and output data.
